>Using cheaply available RFID security door panels and a custom PCB you can turn any ordinary dorm room lock into a smart lock!

## Important Hardware
> Using cheap RFID security door panels that operate under the 125Khz frequency you can hack your door into a convenient and relatively secure smart door. These chinese made readers are not at the same security standards at something like HID's iCLASS operating at 13.56 MHz, but is definitely suitable enough for a college student. These security panels are meant to mate with more expensive control systems but by using my custom made pcb we can now read the outputs of these terminals with an arduino! Then proper actions can be taken to use servos or stepper motors to open the lock of the door.
